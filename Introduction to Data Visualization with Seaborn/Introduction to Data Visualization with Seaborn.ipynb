    "### 1. Introduction to Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:10\n",
    "Hello! Welcome to this introductory course on Seaborn! My name is Erin Case, and I'll be your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is Seaborn?\n",
    "00:10 - 00:30\n",
    "So what is Seaborn? Seaborn is a powerful Python library for creating data visualizations. It was developed in order to make it easy to create the most common types of plots. The plot shown here can be created with just a few lines of Seaborn code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "3. Why is Seaborn useful?\n",
    "00:30 - 00:45\n",
    "This is a picture of a typical data analysis workflow. Data visualization is often a huge component of both the data exploration phase and the communication of results, so Seaborn will be very useful there.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Advantages of Seaborn\n",
    "00:45 - 01:32\n",
    "There are several tools that can be used for data visualization, but Seaborn offers several advantages. First, Seaborn's main purpose is to make data visualization easy. It was built to automatically handle a lot of complexity behind the scenes. Second, Seaborn works extremely well with pandas data structures. pandas is a Python library that is widely used for data analysis. Finally, it's built on top of Matplotlib, which is another Python visualization library. Matplotlib is extremely flexible. Seaborn allows you to take advantage of this flexibility when you need it, while avoiding the complexity that Matplotlib's flexibility can introduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Getting started\n",
    "01:32 - 02:21\n",
    "To get started, we'll need to import the Seaborn library. The line \"import seaborn as sns\" will import Seaborn as the conventionally used alias \"sns\". Why \"sns\"? The Seaborn library was apparently named after a character named Samuel Norman Seaborn from the television show \"The West Wing\" - thus, the standard alias is the character's initials (\"sns\"). We also need to import Matplotlib, which is the library that Seaborn is built on top of. We do this by typing \"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\". \"plt\" is the alias that most people use to refer to Matplotlib, so we'll use that here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Example 1: Scatter plot\n",
    "02:21 - 03:15\n",
    "Let's now dive into an example to illustrate how easily you can create visualizations using Seaborn. Here, we have data for 10 people consisting of lists of their heights in inches and their weights in pounds. Do taller people tend to weigh more? You can visualize this using a type of plot known as a scatter plot, which you'll learn more about later in the course. Use \"sns dot scatterplot()\" to call the scatterplot function from the Seaborn library. Then, specify what to put on the x-axis and y-axis. Finally, call the \"plt dot show()\" function from Matplotlib to show the scatterplot. This plot shows us that taller people tend to have a higher weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Example 2: Create a count plot\n",
    "03:15 - 03:46\n",
    "How many of our observations of heights and weights came from males vs. females? You can use another type of plot - the count plot - to investigate this. Count plots take in a categorical list and return bars that represent the number of list entries per category. Use the \"countplot()\" function and provide the list of every person's gender. This count plot shows that out of the 10 observations we had in our height and weight scatter plot, 6 were male and 4 were female.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Course Preview\n",
    "03:46 - 04:03\n",
    "Now, those were a couple of simple examples. Throughout this course, you'll learn to make more complex visualizations such as those pictured here. More importantly, you'll learn when to use each type of visualization in order to most effectively extract and communicate insights using data.\n",

    "### 2. Using pandas with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:12\n",
    "Data scientists commonly use pandas to perform data analysis, so it's a huge advantage that Seaborn works extremely well with pandas data structures. Let's see how this works!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is pandas?\n",
    "00:12 - 00:37\n",
    "pandas is a python library for data analysis. It can easily read datasets from many types of files including csv and txt files. pandas supports several types of data structures, but the most common one is the DataFrame object. When you read in a dataset with pandas, you will create a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Working with DataFrames\n",
    "00:37 - 01:30\n",
    "Let's look at an example. First, import the pandas library as \"pd\". Then, use the \"read_csv\" function to read the csv file named \"masculinity dot csv\" and create a pandas DataFrame called \"df\". Calling \"head\" on the DataFrame will show us its first five rows. This dataset contains the results of a survey of adult men. We can see that it has four columns: \"participant_id\"; \"age\"; \"how_masculine\", which is that person's response to the question \"how masculine or 'manly' do you feel?\"; and \"how_important\", which is the response to the question \"how important is it to you that others see you as masculine?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using DataFrames with countplot()\n",
    "01:30 - 02:47\n",
    "Now let's look at how to make a count plot with a DataFrame instead of a list of data. The first thing we'll do is import pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn as we have in past examples. Then, we'll create a pandas DataFrame called \"df\" from the masculinity csv file. To create a count plot with a pandas DataFrame column instead of a list of data, set x equal to the name of the column in the DataFrame - in this case, we'll use the \"how_masculine\" column. Then, we'll set the data parameter equal to our DataFrame, \"df\". After calling \"plt dot show\", we can see that we have a nice count plot of the values in the \"how_masculine\" column of our data. This plot shows us that the most common response to the question \"how masculine or 'manly' do you feel?\" is \"somewhat\", with \"very\" being the second most common response. Note also that because we're using a named column in the DataFrame, Seaborn automatically adds the name of the column as the x-axis label at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Tidy\" data\n",
    "02:47 - 03:23\n",
    "Let's pause for an important note here. Seaborn works great with pandas DataFrames, but only if the DataFrame is \"tidy\". \"Tidy data\" means that each observation has its own row and each variable has its own column. The \"masculinity\" DataFrame shown here is tidy because each row is a survey response with one answer to each survey question in each column. Making a count plot with the \"how masculine\" column works just like passing in a list of that column's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"Untidy\" data\n",
    "03:23 - 04:11\n",
    "In contrast, here is an example of an \"untidy\" DataFrame made from the same survey on masculinity. In this untidy DataFrame, notice how each row doesn't contain the same information. Row 0 contains the age categories, rows 1 and 7 contain the question text, and the other rows contain summary data of the responses. This will not work well with Seaborn. Unlike the tidy DataFrame, values in the \"Age\" column don't look like a list of age categories for each observation. Transforming untidy DataFrames into tidy ones is possible, but it's not in scope for this course. There are other DataCamp courses that can teach you how to do this."

    "\n",
    "00:00 - 00:22\n",
    "We saw in the last lesson that a really nice advantage of Seaborn is that it works well with pandas DataFrames. In this lesson, we'll see another big advantage that Seaborn offers: the ability to quickly add a third variable to your plots by adding color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tips dataset\n",
    "00:22 - 00:56\n",
    "To showcase this cool feature in Seaborn, we'll be using Seaborn's built-in tips dataset. You can access it by using the \"load dataset\" function in Seaborn and passing in the name of the dataset. These are the first five rows of the tips dataset. This dataset contains one row for each table served at a restaurant and has information about things like the bill amount, how many people were at the table, and when the table was served. Let's explore the relationship between the \"total_bill\" and \"tip\" columns using a scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "3. A basic scatter plot\n",
    "00:56 - 01:22\n",
    "Here is the code to generate it. The total bill per table (in dollars) is on the x-axis, and the total tip (in dollars) is on the y-axis. We can see from this plot that larger bills are associated with larger tips. What if we want to see which of the data points are smokers versus non-smokers? Seaborn makes this super easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "4. A scatter plot with hue\n",
    "01:22 - 01:50\n",
    "You can set the \"hue\" parameter equal to the DataFrame column name \"smoker\" and then Seaborn will automatically color each point by whether they are a smoker. Plus, it will add a legend to the plot automatically! If you don't want to use pandas, you can set it equal to a list of values instead of a column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "5. Setting hue order\n",
    "01:50 - 02:07\n",
    "Hue also allows you to assert more control over the ordering and coloring of each value. The \"hue order\" parameter takes in a list of values and will set the order of the values in the plot accordingly. Notice how the legend for smoker now lists \"yes\" before \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "6. Specifying hue colors\n",
    "02:07 - 02:46\n",
    "You can also control the colors assigned to each value using the \"palette\" parameter. This parameter takes in a dictionary, which is a data structure that has key-value pairs. This dictionary should map the variable values to the colors you want to represent the value. Here, we create a dictionary called \"hue colors\" that maps the value \"Yes\" to the color black and the value \"No\" to the color red. When we set hue equal to \"smoker\" and the palette parameter equal to this dictionary, we have a scatter plot where smokers are represented with black dots and non-smokers are represented with red dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "7. Color options\n",
    "02:46 - 03:20\n",
    "In the last example, we used the words \"black\" and \"red\" to define what the hue colors should be. This only works for a small set of color names that are defined by Matplotlib. Here is the list of Matplotlib colors and their names. Note that you can use a single-letter Matplotlib abbreviation instead of the full name. You can also use an HTML color hex code instead of these Matplotlib color names, which allows you to choose any color you want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Using HTML hex color codes with hue\n",
    "03:20 - 03:31\n",
    "Here's an example using HTML hex codes. Make sure you put the hex codes in quotes with a pound sign at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "9. Using hue with count plots\n",
    "03:31 - 03:57\n",
    "As a final note, hue is available in most of Seaborn's plot types. For example, this count plot shows the number of observations we have for smokers versus non-smokers, and setting \"hue\" equal to \"sex\" divides these bars into subgroups of males versus females. From this plot, we can see that males outnumber females among both smokers and non-smokers in this dataset.\n",

    "00:50 - 01:12\n",
    "While looking at a relationship between two variables at a high level is often informative, sometimes we suspect that the relationship may be different within certain subgroups. In the last chapter, we started to look at subgroups by using the \"hue\" parameter to visualize each subgroup using a different color on the same plot.\n",

    "7. Introducing relplot()\n",
    "01:20 - 01:54\n",
    "To do this, we're going to introduce a new Seaborn function: \"relplot()\". \"relplot()\" stands for \"relational plot\" and enables you to visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables using either scatter plots or line plots. You've already seen scatter plots, and you'll learn about line plots later in this chapter. Using \"relplot()\" gives us a big advantage: the ability to create subplots in a single figure.

    "2. Scatter plot overview\n",
    "00:07 - 00:59\n",
    "As a reminder, scatter plots are a great tool for visualizing the relationship between two quantitative variables. We've seen a few ways to add more information to them as well, by creating subplots or plotting subgroups with different colored points. In addition to these, Seaborn allows you to add more information to scatter plots by varying the size, the style, and the transparency of the points. All of these options can be used in both the \"scatterplot()\" and \"relplot()\" functions, but we'll continue to use \"relplot()\" for the rest of the course since it's more flexible and allows us to create subplots. For the rest of this lesson, we'll use the tips dataset to learn how to use each customization and cover best practices for deciding which customizations to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Subgroups with point size\n",
    "00:59 - 01:48\n",
    "The first customization we'll talk about is point size. Here, we're creating a scatter plot of total bill versus tip amount. We want each point on the scatter plot to be sized based on the number of people in the group, with larger groups having bigger points on the plot. To do this, we'll set the \"size\" parameter equal to the variable name \"size\" from our dataset. As this example demonstrates, varying point size is best used if the variable is either a quantitative variable or a categorical variable that represents different levels of something, like \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\". This plot is a bit hard to read because all of the points are of the same color.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Point size and hue\n",
    "01:48 - 02:22\n",
    "We can make it easier by using the \"size\" parameter in combination with the \"hue\" parameter. To do this, set \"hue\" equal to the variable name \"size\". Notice that because \"size\" is a quantitative variable, Seaborn will automatically color the points different shades of the same color instead of different colors per category value like we saw in previous plots. Now larger groups have both larger and darker points, which provides better contrast and makes the plot easier to read.\n",
    "\n",

    "5. Subgroups with point style\n",
    "02:22 - 02:52\n",
    "The next customization we'll look at is the point style. Setting the \"style\" parameter to a variable name will use different point styles for each value of the variable. Here's a scatter plot we've seen before, where we use \"hue\" to create different colored points based on smoking status. Setting \"style\" equal to \"smoker\" allows us to better distinguish these subgroups by plotting smokers with a different point style in addition to a different color.\n",

    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "6. Changing point transparency\n",
    "02:52 - 03:28\n",
    "The last customization we'll look at is point transparency. Setting the \"alpha\" parameter to a value between 0 and 1 will vary the transparency of the points in the plot, with 0 being completely transparent and 1 being completely non-transparent. Here, we've set \"alpha\" equal to 0.4. This customization can be useful when you have many overlapping points on the scatter plot, so you can see which areas of the plot have more or less observations.\n",

    "In Seaborn, we have two types of relational plots: scatter plots and line plots. While each point in a scatter plot is assumed to be an independent observation, line plots are the visualization of choice when we need to track the same thing over time. A common example is tracking the value of a company's stock over time, as shown here.\n",

    "In this video, we'll be using data on the levels of air pollution in a city. There are many air collection stations around the city, each measuring the nitrogen dioxide level every hour for a single day. Long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen dioxide can cause chronic lung diseases. Let's begin with the simple case where we have one data point per x-value. Here we have one row per hour over the course of the day with the average nitrogen dioxide level across all the stations in a column called \"NO_2_mean\".\n",

    "4. Scatter plot\n",
    "01:15 - 01:29\n",

    "5. Line plot\n",
    "01:29 - 01:44\n",
    "By specifying \"kind\" equals \"line\", we can create a line plot and more easily see how the average nitrogen dioxide level fluctuates throughout the day.\n",

    "6. Subgroups by location\n",
    "01:44 - 01:59\n",

    "7. Subgroups by location\n",
    "01:59 - 02:21\n",
    "Setting the \"style\" and \"hue\" parameters equal to the variable name \"location\" creates different lines for each region that vary in both line style and color. Here, we can see that the South region tends to have slightly higher average nitrogen dioxide levels compared to the other regions.\n",

    "8. Adding markers\n",
    "02:21 - 02:38\n",

Assuming the air collection stations were randomly placed throughout the city, this dataset is a random sample of the nitrogen dioxide levels across the whole city. This confidence interval tells us that based on our sample, we can be 95% confident that the average nitrogen dioxide level for the whole city is within this range. Confidence intervals indicate the uncertainty we have about what the true mean is for the whole city. To learn more about confidence intervals, you can check out DataCamp's statistics courses.\n",

Categorical plots involve a categorical variable, which is a variable that consists of a fixed, typically small number of possible values, or categories. These types of plots are commonly used when we want to make comparisons between different groups. We began to explore categorical plots in Chapter 1 with count plots. As a reminder, a count plot displays the number of observations in each category. We saw several examples of count plots in earlier chapters, like the number of men reporting that they feel masculine. Most men surveyed here feel \"somewhat\" or \"very\" masculine.\n",

To change the order of the categories, create a list of category values in the order that you want them to appear, and then use the \"order\" parameter. This works for all types of categorical plots, not just count plots.\n",

    "7. Bar plots\n",
    "02:33 - 03:18\n",
    "Bar plots look similar to count plots, but instead of the count of observations in each category, they show the mean of a quantitative variable among observations in each category. This bar plot uses the tips dataset and shows the average bill paid among people who visited the restaurant on each day of the week. From this, we can see that the average bill is slightly higher on the weekends. To create this bar plot, we use \"catplot\".

    "00:09 - 01:13\n",
    "A box plot shows the distribution of quantitative data. The colored box represents the 25th to 75th percentile, and the line in the middle of the box represents the median. The whiskers give a sense of the spread of the distribution, and the floating points represent outliers. Box plots are commonly used as a way to compare the distribution of a quantitative variable across different groups of a categorical variable. To see this, let's look at this example. The box plot shown here uses the tips dataset and compares the distribution of the total bill paid per table across the different days of the week. From this box plot we can quickly see that the median bill is higher on Saturday and Sunday, but the spread of the distribution is also larger. This comparison would be much harder to do with other types of visualizations.\n",

We'll put the categorical variable \"time\" on the x-axis and the quantitative variable \"total bill\" on the y-axis. Here, we want box plots, so we'll specify kind=\"box\". That's it!

If you want to change the way the whiskers in your box plot are defined, you can do this using the \"whis\" parameter. There are several options for changing the whiskers. You can change the range of the whiskers from 1 point 5 times the IQR (which is the default) to 2 times the IQR by setting \"whis\" equal to 2 point 0. Alternatively, you can have the whiskers define specific lower and upper percentiles by passing in a list of the lower and upper values. In this example, passing in \"[5, 95]\" will result in the lower whisker being drawn at the 5th percentile and the upper whisker being drawn at the 95th percentile. Finally, you may just want to draw the whiskers at the min and max values. You can do this by specifying the lower percentile as 0 and the upper percentile as 100.\n",

This is the same information, represented as a point plot. In the point plot, it's easier to compare the heights of the subgroup points when they're stacked above each other.

    "### 2. Adding titles and labels: Part 1\n",
    "00:00 - 00:14\n",
    "Welcome! In the next two lessons, we'll go over one of the most important parts of any data visualization: plot titles and axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating informative visualizations\n",
    "00:14 - 01:22\n",
    "We create data visualizations to communicate information, and we can't do that effectively without a clear title and informative axis labels. To see this, let's compare two versions of the same visualization. On the left, we see box plots showing the distribution of birth rates for countries in each of 11 regions. On the right, we see the same visualization with three key modifications to make it easier to understand. A title is added, which immediately orients the audience to what they're looking at. The axis labels are more informative, making it clearer that birth rate is measured per one thousand people and birth rates are measured per country in each region. Finally, the x-axis tick labels are rotated to make it clear what each region is called. Let's learn how to make these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. FacetGrid vs. AxesSubplot objects\n",
    "01:22 - 01:57\n",
    "Before we go into the details of adding a title, we need to understand an underlying mechanism in Seaborn. Seaborn's plot functions create two different types of objects: FacetGrids and AxesSubplots. To figure out which type of object you're working with, first assign the plot output to a variable. In the documentation, the variable is often named \"g\", so we'll do that here as well. Write \"type\" \"g\" to return the object type. This scatter plot is an AxesSubplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An Empty FacetGrid\n",
    "01:57 - 02:06\n",
    "A FacetGrid consists of one or more AxesSubplots, which is how it supports subplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. FacetGrid vs. AxesSubplot objects\n",
    "02:06 - 02:28\n",
    "Recall that \"relplot()\" and \"catplot()\" both support making subplots. This means that they are creating FacetGrid objects. In contrast, single-type plot functions like \"scatterplot()\" and \"countplot()\" return a single AxesSubplot object.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adding a title to FacetGrid\n",
    "02:28 - 03:07\n",
    "Let's return to our messy plot from the beginning. Recall that \"catplot()\" enables subplots, so it returns a FacetGrid object. To add a title to a FacetGrid object, first assign the plot to the variable \"g\". After you assign the plot to \"g\", you can set the title using \"g dot fig dot suptitle\". This tells Seaborn you want to set a title for the figure as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adjusting height of title in FacetGrid\n",
    "03:07 - 03:20\n",
    "Note that by default, the figure title might be a little low. To adjust the height of the title, you can use the \"y\" parameter. The default value is 1, so setting it to 1 point 03 will make it a little higher than the default."

    "### 3. Adding titles and labels: Part 2\n",
    "00:00 - 00:09\n",
    "Hello! In this lesson, we'll continue learning how to customize plot titles and axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding a title to AxesSubplot\n",
    "00:09 - 00:38\n",
    "In the last lesson, we learned how to add a title to a FacetGrid object using \"g dot fig dot suptitle\". To add a title to an AxesSubplot object like that from the \"box plot\" function, assign the plot to a variable and use “g dot set_title”. You can also use the “y” parameter here to adjust the height of the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Titles for subplots\n",
    "00:38 - 00:57\n",
    "Now let's look at what happens if the figure has subplots. Let's say we've divided countries into two groups - group one and group two - and we've set \"col\" equal to \"Group\" to create a subplot for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Titles for subplots\n",
    "00:57 - 01:08\n",
    "Since g is a FacetGrid object, using \"g dot fig dot suptitle\" will add a title to the figure as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Titles for subplots\n",
    "01:08 - 01:34\n",
    "To alter the subplot titles, use \"g dot set_titles\" to set the titles for each AxesSubplot. If you want to use the variable name in the title, you can use \"col name\" in braces to reference the column value. Here, we've created subplot titles that display as \"this is group 2\" and \"this is group 1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adding axis labels\n",
    "01:34 - 01:58\n",
    "To add axis labels, assign the plot to a variable and then call the \"set\" function. Set the parameters \"x label\" and \"y label\" to set the desired x-axis and y-axis labels, respectively. This works with both FacetGrid and AxesSubplot objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Rotating x-axis tick labels\n",
    "01:58 - 02:35\n",
    "Sometimes, like in the example we've seen in this lesson, your tick labels may overlap, making it hard to interpret the plot. One way to address this is by rotating the tick labels. To do this, we don't call a function on the plot object itself. Instead, after we create the plot, we call the matplotlib function \"plt dot xticks\" and set \"rotation\" equal to 90 degrees. This works with both FacetGrid and AxesSubplot objects."

    "### 4. Putting it all together\n",
    "00:00 - 00:18\n",
    "In this course, we've learned a great deal about how to create effective data visualizations in Seaborn. In this lesson, we'll review what we've learned and connect the pieces together to form a cohesive picture of how to use Seaborn for future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Getting started\n",
    "00:18 - 00:50\n",
    "The first thing to recall is simply how to import Seaborn and its related library, Matplotlib. To do this, write \"import seaborn as sns\" and \"import matplotlib dot pyplot as plt\". Recall also that at the end of your data visualization code, you'll call \"plt dot show\" to show the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Relational plots\n",
    "00:50 - 01:25\n",
    "After you've imported the appropriate libraries, the next thing to do is to choose what type of plot you want to create. Relational plots are plots that show the relationship between two quantitative variables. Examples of relational plots that we've seen in this course are scatter plots and line plots. You can create a relational plot using \"relplot()\" and providing it with the x-axis variable name, y-axis variable name, the pandas tidy DataFrame, and the type of plot (either scatter or line).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Categorical plots\n",
    "01:25 - 02:08\n",
    "Categorical plots are another type of plot. These describe the distribution of a quantitative variable within categories given by a categorical variable. Examples of categorical plots we've seen are bar plots, count plots, box plots, and point plots. You can create a categorical plot using \"catplot()\" and providing it with the x-axis variable name, y-axis variable name (if applicable), the pandas tidy DataFrame, and the type of plot (either bar, count, box, or point).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adding a third variable (hue)\n",
    "02:08 - 02:25\n",
    "If we want to add a third dimension to our plots, we can do this in one of two ways. Setting the \"hue\" parameter to a variable name will create a single plot but will show subgroups that are different colors based on that variable's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "6. Adding a third variable (row/col)\n",
    "02:25 - 02:39\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use \"relplot()\" and \"catplot()\"’s \"col\" and \"row\" parameters to graph each subgroup on a separate subplot in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Waskom, M. L. (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. https://seaborn.pydata.org/\n",
    "7. Customization\n",
    "02:39 - 03:00\n",
    "Once you have the basic plot created, you might want to customize the plot's appearance to improve its readability. You can change the background of the plot using \"set_style\", the color of the main elements using \"set_palette\", and the scale of the plot using \"set_context\".\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Adding a title\n",
    "03:00 - 03:16\n",
    "Finally, every plot should be given an informative title and axis labels. Recall the two types of plot objects - FacetGrids and AxesSubplots - and the way to add a title to each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Final touches\n",
    "03:16 - 03:34\n",
    "Also recall how to use the \"set\" function with the \"xlabel\" and \"ylabel\" parameters to provide custom x- and y-axis labels, and how to use \"plt.xticks\" with the \"rotation\" parameter to rotate the x-tick labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Let's practice!\n",
    "03:34 - 03:47\n",
    "And that's it! You're now equipped to make impressive and effective data visualizations with Seaborn. Let's practice putting all of these steps together in the final exercises of this course."
