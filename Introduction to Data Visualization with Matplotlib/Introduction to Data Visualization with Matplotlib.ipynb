    "1. Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "00:00 - 00:18\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this course on data visualization with Matplotlib! A picture is worth a thousand words. Data visualizations let you derive insights from data and let you communicate about the data with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data visualization\n",
    "00:18 - 01:12\n",
    "For example, this visualization shows an animated history of an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. The amount of information in this complex visualization is simply staggering! This visualization was created using Matplotlib, a Python library that is widely used to visualize data. There are many software libraries that visualize data. One of the main advantages of Matplotlib is that it gives you complete control over the properties of your plot. This allows you to customize and control the precise properties of your visualizations. At the end of this course, you will know not only how to control your visualizations, but also how to create programs that automatically create visualizations based on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Introducing the pyplot interface\n",
    "01:12 - 02:19\n",
    "There are many different ways to use Matplotlib. In this course, we will use the main object-oriented interface. This interface is provided through the pyplot submodule. Here, we import this submodule and name it plt. While using the name plt is not necessary for the program to work, this is a very strongly-followed convention, and we will follow it here as well. The plt-dot-subplots command, when called without any inputs, creates two different objects: a Figure object and an Axes object. The Figure object is a container that holds everything that you see on the page. Meanwhile, the Axes is the part of the page that holds the data. It is the canvas on which we will draw with our data, to visualize it. Here, you can see a Figure with empty Axes. No data has been added yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Adding data to axes\n",
    "02:19 - 02:50\n",
    "Let's add some data to our figure. Here is some data. This is a DataFrame that contains information about the weather in the city of Seattle in the different months of the year. The \"MONTH\" column contains the three-letter names of the months of the year. The \"monthly average normal temperature\" column contains the temperatures in these months, in Fahrenheit degrees, averaged over a ten-year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Adding data to axes\n",
    "02:50 - 03:41\n",
    "To add the data to the Axes, we call a plotting command. The plotting commands are methods of the Axes object. For example, here we call the method called plot with the month column as the first argument and the temperature column as the second argument. Finally, we call the plt-dot-show function to show the effect of the plotting command. This adds a line to the plot. The horizontal dimension of the plot represents the months according to their order and the height of the line at each month represents the average temperature. The trends in the data are now much clearer than they were just by reading off the temperatures from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Adding more data\n",
    "03:41 - 03:59\n",
    "If you want, you can add more data to the plot. For example, we also have a table that stores data about the average temperatures in the city of Austin, Texas. We add these data to the axes by calling the plot method again.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Putting it all together\n",
    "03:59 - 04:21\n",
    "Here is what all of the code to create this figure would then look like. First, we create the Figure and the Axes objects. We call the Axes method plot to add first the Seattle temperatures, and then the Austin temperatures to the Axes. Finally, we ask Matplotlib to show us the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Practice making a figure!\n",
    "04:21 - 04:33\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Customizing your plots\n",
    "00:00 - 00:08\n",
    "Now that you know how to add data to a plot, let's start customizing your plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Customizing data appearance\n",
    "00:08 - 00:43\n",
    "First let's customize the appearance of the data in the plot. Here is the code that you previously used to plot the data about the weather in Seattle. One of the things that you might want to improve about this plot is that the data appears to be continuous, but it was actually only measured in monthly intervals. A way to indicate this would be to add markers to the plot that show us where the data exists and which parts are just lines that connect between the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adding markers\n",
    "00:43 - 01:06\n",
    "The plot method takes an optional keyword argument, marker, which lets you indicate that you are interested in adding markers to the plot and also what kind of markers you'd like. For example, passing the lower-case letter \"o\" indicates that you would like to use circles as markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choosing markers\n",
    "01:06 - 01:38\n",
    "If you were to pass a lower case letter \"v\" instead, you would get markers shaped like triangles pointing downwards. To see all the possible marker styles, you can visit this page in the Matplotlib online documentation. In these versions of the plot, the measured data appears as markers of some shape, and it becomes more apparent that the lines are just connectors between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Setting the linestyle\n",
    "01:38 - 02:06\n",
    "But you can go even further to emphasize this by changing the appearance of these connecting lines. This is done by adding the linestyle keyword argument. Here two dashes are used to indicate that the line should be dashed. Like marker shapes, there are a few linestyles you can choose from, listed in this documentation page.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Eliminating lines with linestyle\n",
    "02:06 - 02:18\n",
    "You can even go so far as to eliminate the lines altogether, by passing the string \"None\" as input to this keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Choosing color\n",
    "02:18 - 02:31\n",
    "Finally, you can choose the color that you would like to use for the data. For example, here we've chosen to show this data in red, indicated by the letter \"r\".\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Customizing the axes labels\n",
    "02:31 - 03:44\n",
    "Another important thing to customize are the axis labels. If you want your visualizations to communicate properly you need to always label the axes. This is really important but is something that is often neglected. In addition to the plot method, the Axes object has several methods that start with the word set. These are methods that you can use to change certain properties of the object, before calling show to display it. For example, there is a set-underscore-xlabel method that you can use to set the value of the label of the x-axis. Note that we capitalize axis labels as we would capitalize a sentence, where only the first word is always capitalized and subsequent words are capitalized only if they are proper nouns. If you then call plt-dot-show you will see that the axis now has a label that indicates that the values on the x-axis denote time in months.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Setting the y axis label\n",
    "03:44 - 04:04\n",
    "Similarly, a set-underscore-ylabel method customizes the label that is associated with the y-axis. Here, we set the label to indicate that the height of the line in each month indicates the average temperature in that month.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Adding a title\n",
    "04:04 - 04:21\n",
    "Finally, you can also add a title to your Axes using the set-underscore-title method. This adds another source of information about the data to provide context for your visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Practice customizing your plots!\n",
    "04:21 - 04:36\n",
    "OK. Now that you have seen some examples of customizing the appearance of the data in your plots, and the axis labels, it's time to get a bit of practice with these concepts."

    "\n",
    "2. Adding data\n",
    "00:12 - 00:29\n",
    "For example, let's explore the data we have about weather in Seattle. Here we plot average precipitation in Seattle during the course of the year. But let's say that we are also interested in the range of values.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. And more data\n",
    "00:45 - 00:53\n",
    "This code adds the data from Austin to the plot. When we display the plot,\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Too much data!\n",
    "00:53 - 01:17\n",
    "it's a bit of a mess. There's too much data in this plot. One way to overcome this kind of mess is to use what are called small multiples. These are multiple small plots that show similar data across different conditions. For example, precipitation data across different cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Small multiples with plt.subplots\n",
    "01:17 - 02:08\n",
    "In Matplotlib, small multiples are called sub-plots. That is also the reason that the function that creates these is called subplots. Previously, we called this function with no inputs. This creates one subplot. Now, we'll give it some inputs. Small multiples are typically arranged on the page as a grid with rows and columns. Here, we are creating a Figure object with three rows of subplots, and two columns. This is what this would look like before we add any data to it. In this case, the variable ax is no longer only one Axes object.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adding data to subplots\n",
    "02:08 - 02:24\n",
    "Instead, it is an array of Axes objects with a shape of 3 by 2. To add data, we would now have to index into this object and call the plot method on an element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Subplots with data\n",
    "02:24 - 03:32\n",
    "There is a special case for situations where you have only one row or only one column of plots. In this case, the resulting array will be one-dimensional and you will only have to provide one index to access the elements of this array. For example, consider what we might do with the rainfall data that we were plotting before. We create a figure and an array of Axes objects with two rows and one column. We address the first element in this array, which is the top sub-plot, and add the data for Seattle to this plot. Then, we address the second element in the array, which is the bottom plot, and add the data from Austin to it. We can add a y-axis label to each one of these. Because they are one on top of the other, we only add an x-axis label to the bottom plot, by addressing only the second element in the array of Axes objects. When we show this,\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Subplots with data\n",
    "03:32 - 03:56\n",
    "we see that the data are now cleanly presented in a way that facilitates the direct comparison between the two cities. One thing we still need to take care of is the range of the y-axis in the two plots, which is not exactly the same. This is because the highest and lowest values in the two datasets are not identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Sharing the y-axis range\n",
    "03:56 - 04:24\n",
    "To make sure that all the subplots have the same range of y-axis values, we initialize the figure and its subplots with the key-word argument sharey set to True. This means that both subplots will have the same range of y-axis values, based on the data from both datasets. Now the comparison across datasets is more straightforward."

The \"date\" column indicates when the recording was made and is stored in the year-month-date format. A measurement was taken on the 6th day of every month from 1958 until 2016. The column \"co2\" contains measurements of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The number shown in each row is parts-per-million of carbon dioxide. The column \"relative-underscore-temp\" denotes the temperature measured at this date, relative to a baseline which is the average temperature in the first ten years of measurements. If we want pandas to recognize that this is a time-series, we'll need to tell it to parse the \"date\" column as a date. To use the full power of pandas indexing facilities, we'll also designate the date column as our index by using the index-underscore-col key-word argument.\n",

We add the index of our DataFrame for the x-axis and the \"co2\" column for the y-axis. We also label the x- and y-axes. Matplotlib automatically chooses to show the time on the x-axis as years, with intervals of 10 years. The data visualization tells a clear story: there are some small seasonal fluctuations in the amount of CO2 measured, and an overall increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from about 320 parts per million to about 400 parts per million.\n",

Again, we start by adding the first variable to our Axes. Then, we use the twinx method to create a twin of this Axes. This means that the two Axes share the same x-axis, but the y-axes are separate. We add the other variable to this second Axes object and show the figure. There is one y-axis scale on the left, for the carbon dioxide variable, and another y-axis scale to the right for the temperature variable. Now you can see the fluctuations in temperature more clearly. But this is still not quite right. The two lines have the same color. Let's take care of that.\n",

We also set the color in our call to the set-underscore-ylabel function. We repeat this in our calls to plot and set-underscore-ylabel from the twin Axes object. In the resulting figure, each variable has its own color and the y-axis labels clearly tell us which scale belongs to which variable.\n",

This is done by adding a call to the tick-underscore-params method. This method takes either y or x as its first argument, pointing to the fact that we are modifying the parameters of the y-axis ticks and tick labels. To change their color, we use the colors key-word argument, setting it to blue. Similarly, we call the tick-underscore-params method from the twin Axes object, setting the colors for these ticks to red.\n",

Here again is the code that generates the plot, using the function that we implemented previously. Next, we call a method of the Axes object called annotate. At the very least, this function takes the annotation text as input, in this case, the string \">1 degree\", and the xy coordinate that we would like to annotate. Here, the value to annotate has the x position of the TimeStamp of that date. We use the pandas time-stamp object to define that. The y position of the data is 1, which is the 1 degree Celsius value at that date. But this doesn't look great. The text appears on top of the axis tick labels. Maybe we can move it somewhere else?\n",

    "Let's start by reading the data in from a file. We tell pandas to create a DataFrame from a file that contains the data and to use the first column, which contains the country names, as the index for the DataFrame. Next, we can visualize the data about gold medals. We create a Figure and an Axes object and call the Axes bar method to create a bar chart. This chart shows a bar for every row in the \"Gold\" column of the DataFrame, where the height of the bar represents the number in that row. The labels of the x-axis ticks correspond to the index of the DataFrame, which contains the names of the different countries in the data table. Unfortunately, these names are rather long, so they overlap with each other. Let's fix that first.\n",

We also take the opportunity to add a label on the y-axis, telling us that the height corresponds to the number of medals. This looks good. Visualizing the data in this way shows us which countries got a high or low number of gold medals, but also allows us to see the differences between countries, based on the difference in heights between the bars.\n",

This means that each new data will be stacked on top of the previous data. It starts the same way as before. Next, we add another call to the bar method to add the data from the \"Silver\" column of the DataFrame. We add the bottom key-word argument to tell Matplotlib that the bottom of this column's data should be at the height of the previous column's data. We add the x-axis tick labels, rotating them by 90 degrees, set the y-axis labels, and call plt-dot-show.\n",

We've extracted two DataFrames from this data: all of the medal winners in men's gymnastics and all of the medal winners in men's rowing. Here are the five first rows in the men's rowing DataFrame. You can see that the data contains different kinds of information: what kinds of medals each competitor won, and also the competitor's height and weight.\n",

    "Let's start by seeing what a comparison of heights would look like with a bar chart. After creating the Figure and Axes objects, we add to them a bar with the mean of the rowing \"Height\" column. Then, we add a bar with the mean of the gymnastics \"Height\" column. We set the y-axis label and show the figure, which gives us a sense for the difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Introducing histograms\n",
    "01:29 - 02:41\n",
    "But a histogram would instead show the full distribution of values within each variable. Let's see that. We start again by initializing a Figure and Axes. We then call the Axes hist method with the entire \"Height\" column of the men's rowing DataFrame. We repeat this with the men's gymnastics DataFrame. In the histogram shown, the x-axis is the values within the variable and the height of the bars represents the number of observations within a particular bin of values. For example, there are 12 gymnasts with heights between 164 and 167 centimeters, so the highest bar in the orange histogram is 12 units high. Similarly, there are 20 rowers with heights between 188 and 192 centimeters, and the highest bar in the blue histogram is 20 units high.\n",

    "5. Labels are needed\n",
    "02:41 - 03:10\n",

As before, we can label a variable by calling the hist method with the label key-word argument and then calling the legend method before we call plt-dot-show, so that a legend appears in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Customizing histograms: setting the number of bins\n",
    "03:10 - 03:37\n",
    "You might be wondering how Matplotlib decides how to divide the data up into the different bars. Per default, the number of bars or bins in a histogram is 10, but we can customize that. If we provide an integer number to the bins key-word argument, the histogram will have that number of bins.\n",

Looking at this figure, you might wonder whether there are any rowing medalists with a height of less than 180 centimeters. This is hard to tell because the bars for the gymnastics histogram are occluding this information.\n",

    "8. Customizing histograms: transparency\n",
    "04:09 - 04:30\n",
    "The occlusion can be eliminated by changing the type of histogram that is used. Instead of the \"bar\" type that is used per default, you can specify a histtype of \"step\", which displays the histogram as thin lines, instead of solid bars,\n",

    "00:29 - 01:46\n",
    "The first is the use of error bars in plots. These are additional markers on a plot or bar chart that tell us something about the distribution of the data. Histograms, that you have seen in the previous lesson, show the entire distribution. Error bars instead summarize the distribution of the data in one number, such as the standard deviation of the values. To demonstrate this, we'll use the data about heights of medalists in the 2016 Olympic Games. There are at least two different ways to display error bars. Here, we add the error bar as an argument to a bar chart. Each call to the ax-dot-bar method takes an x argument and a y argument. In this case, y is the mean of the \"Height\" column. The yerr key-word argument takes an additional number. In this case, the standard deviation of the \"Height\" column, and displays that as an additional vertical marker.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Adding error bars to plots\n",
    "02:03 - 02:49\n",
    "We can also add error bars to a line plot. For example, let's look at the weather data that we used in the first chapter of this course. To plot this data with error bars, we will use the Axes errorbar method. Like the plot method, this method takes a sequence of x values, in this case, the \"MONTH\" column, and a sequence of y values, in this case, the column with the normal average monthly temperatures. In addition, a yerr key-word argument can take the column in the data that contains the standard deviations of the average monthly temperatures.\n",

    "The second statistical visualization technique we will look at is the boxplot, a visualization technique invented by John Tukey, arguably the first data scientist. It is implemented as a method of the Axes object. We can call it with a sequence of sequences. In this case, we create a list with the men's rowing \"Height\" column and the men's gymnastics \"Height\" column and pass that list to the method. Because the box-plot doesn't know the labels on each of the variables, we add that separately, labeling the y-axis as well. Finally, we show the figure, which looks\n",

    "7. Interpreting boxplots\n",
    "03:40 - 04:47\n",
    "like this. This kind of plot shows us several landmarks in each distribution. The red line indicates the median height. The edges of the box portion at the center indicate the inter-quartile range of the data, between the 25th and the 75th percentiles. The whiskers at the ends of the thin bars indicate one and a half times the size of the inter-quartile range beyond the 75th and 25th percentiles. This should encompass roughly 99 percent of the distribution if the data is Gaussian or normal. Points that appear beyond the whiskers are outliers. That means that they have values larger or smaller than what you would expect for 99 percent of the data in a Gaussian or normal distribution. For example, there are three unusually short rowers in this sample, and one unusually high gymnast.\n",

    "00:24 - 01:39\n",
    "A standard visualization for bi-variate comparisons is a scatter plot. Let's look at an example. We'll use the climate change data that we have used previously. Recall that this dataset has a column with measurements of carbon dioxide and a column with concurrent measurements of the relative temperature. Because these measurements are paired up in this way, we can represent each measurement as a point, with the distance along the x-axis representing the measurement in one column and the height on the y-axis representing the measurement in the other column. To create this plot, we initialize a Figure and Axes objects and call the Axes scatter method. The first argument to this method will correspond to the distance along the x-axis and the second argument will correspond to the height along the y-axis. We also set the x-axis and y-axis labels, so that we can tell how to interpret the plot and call plt-dot-show to display the figure.\n",

    "3. Customizing scatter plots\n",
    "01:39 - 03:10\n",
    "We can customize scatter plots in a manner that is similar to the customization that we introduced in other plots. For example, if we want to show two bivariate comparisons side-by-side, we want to make sure that they are visually distinct. Here, we are going to plot two scatter plots on the same axes. In one, we'll show the data from the nineteen-eighties and in the other, we'll show the data from the nineteen-nineties. We can select these parts of the data using the time-series indexing that you've seen before to create two DataFrames called eighties and nineties. Then, we add each one of these DataFrames into the Axes object. First, we add the data from the eighties. We add customization: we set the color of the points to be red and we label these data with the string \"eighties\". Then, we add the data from the nineties. These points will be blue and we label them with the string \"nineties\". We call the legend method to add a legend that will tell us which DataFrame is identified with which color, we add the axis labels and call plt-dot-show.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Encoding a third variable by color\n",
    "03:34 - 04:17\n",
    "But we can also use the color of the points to encode a third variable, providing additional information about the comparison. In the climate change data, we have a continuous variable denoting time stored in the DataFrame index. If we enter the index as input to the c key-word argument, this variable will get encoded as color. Note that this is not the color key-word argument that we used before, but is instead just the letter c. As before, we set the axis labels and call plt-dot-show.\n",

Maybe you know this library and this looks familiar to you, or you can learn about ggplot in a DataCamp course devoted to this library. Either way, you will notice that the setting of the style didn't change the appearance of just one element in the figure. Rather, it changed multiple elements: the colors are different, the fonts used in the text are different, and there is an added gray background that creates a faint white grid marking the x-axis and y-axis tick locations within the plot area. Furthermore, this style will now apply to all of the figures in this session, until you change it by choosing another style.\n",

    "How would you choose which style to use? If your goal is primarily to communicate with others, think about how they might see it. Dark backgrounds are generally discouraged as they are less visible, so only use them if you have a good reason to do so. If colors are important, consider using a colorblind-friendly style, such as \"seaborn-colorblind\" or \"tableau-colorblind10\". These are designed to retain color differences even when viewed by colorblind individuals. That might sound like a minor consideration, but approximately 1 out of 20 individuals is colorblind. Figures that are designed for use on websites have different considerations than figures in printed reports. For example, if someone is going to print out your figures, you might want to use less ink. That is, avoid colored backgrounds, like the background that appears in the \"ggplot\" style that we demonstrated before. If the printer used is likely to be black-and-white, consider using the \"grayscale\" style. This will retain the differences you see on your screen when printed out in a black-and-white printer.\n",

If we do this, the figure will no longer appear on our screen, but instead appear as a file on our file-system called \"gold-underscore-medals-dot-png\". In the interactive Python shell that we are using here, we can call the unix ls function, which gives us a listing of the files in the present working directory. In this case, only the file that we created is present. We can then share this file that now contains the visualization with others.\n",

That means that the image will retain high quality, but will also take up relatively large amounts of diskspace or bandwidth. You can choose other file formats, depending on your need. For example, if the image is going to be part of a website, you might want to choose the jpg format used here, instead. This format uses lossy compression, and can be used to create figures that take up less diskspace and less bandwidth. You can control how small the resulting file will be, and the degree of loss of quality, by setting the quality key-word argument. This will be a number between 1 and 100, but you should avoid values above 95, because at that point the compression is no longer effective. Choosing the svg file-format will produce a vector graphics file where different elements can be edited in detail by advanced graphics software, such as Gimp or Adobe Illustrator. If you need to edit the figure after producing it, this might be a good choice.\n",

    "Another key-word that you can use to control the quality of the images that you produce is the dpi key-word argument. This stands for dots per inch. The higher this number, the more densely the image will be rendered. If you set this number to 300, for example, this will render a fairly high-quality resolution of your image to file. Of course, the higher the resolution that you ask for, the larger the file-size will be.\n",

This is one of the major benefits of using a programming language like Python and software libraries such as Matplotlib, over tools that require you to interact with a graphical user interface every time you want to create a new figure. Inspecting the incoming data and changing the behavior of the program based on the data provides flexibility, as well as robustness. Finally, an automatic program that adjusts to the data provides reproducible behavior across different runs.\n",

    "3. How many different kinds of data?\n",
    "01:17 - 01:56\n",
    "Let's see what that means for Matplotlib. Consider the data about Olympic medal winners that we've looked at before. Until now, we always looked at two different branches of sports and compared them to each other, but what if we get a new data file, and we don't know how many different sports branches are included in the data? For example, what if we had a data-frame with hundreds of rows and a \"Sport\" column that indicates which branch of sport each row belongs to.\n",

    "4. Getting unique values of a column\n",
    "01:56 - 02:18\n",
    "A column in a pandas DataFrame is a pandas Series object, so we can get the list of different sports present in the data by calling the unique method of that column. This tells us that there are 10 different branches of sport here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bar-chart of heights for all sports\n",
    "02:18 - 04:02\n",
    "Let's say that we would like to visualize the height of athletes in each one of the sports, with a standard deviation error bar. Given that we don't know in advance how many sports there are in the DataFrame, once we've extracted the unique values, we can loop over them. In each iteration through, we set a loop variable called sport to be equal to one of these unique values. We then create a smaller DataFrame, that we call sport-underscore-d-f, by selecting the rows in which the \"Sport\" column is equal to the sport selected in this iteration. We can call the bar method of the Axes we created for this plot. As before, it is called with the string that holds the name of the sport as the first argument, the mean method of the \"Height\" column is set to be the height of the bar and an error bar is set to be equal to the standard deviation of the values in the column. After iterating over all of the sports, we exit the loop. We can then set the y-label to indicate the meaning of the height of each bar and we can set the x-axis tick labels to be equal to the names of the sports. As we did with the country names in the stacked bar chart that you saw in a previous lesson, we rotate these labels 90 degrees, so that they don't run over each other.\n",

    "6. Figure derived automatically from the data\n",
    "04:02 - 04:23\n",
    "This is what this figure would look like. Importantly, at no point during the creation of this figure did we need to know how many different sports are recorded in the DataFrame. Our code would automatically add bars or reduce the number of bars, depending on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Practice automating visualizations!\n",
    "04:23 - 04:35\n",
    "In the exercises that follow, you will use this principle to create visualizations that adapt to the data provided."
